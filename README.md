# **Portfolio Performance Tracker**
The **Portfolio Performance Tracker** is designed to simplify investment tracking for individuals managing a portfolio of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. Instead of manually tracking each asset, this web application automates the process of gathering real-time and historical data, calculating the value of each asset, and providing a clear overview of your overall portfolio performance.

### Use Case Example
Imagine you have invested in Apple stock, or another asset in the stock market. Tracking the fluctuating values of these assets can be overwhelming. This application allows you to input each asset, specify its purchase price and date, and then sit back while the app retrieves real-time prices and calculates how well your portfolio is performing. With an easy-to-use web interface, users can see their portfolio performance metrics at a glance.
